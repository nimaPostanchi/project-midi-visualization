/*
    Once you have a list of notes, you can visualize them using
    the Bitmap class.

    Write a function

        Bitmap visualize(const std::vector<NOTE>&)

    that returns a Bitmap containining a visualization of the notes.
    You have some freedom of how to do this (colors, size of shapes, ...)
    The music should be recognizable. See the sample MIDI files.
